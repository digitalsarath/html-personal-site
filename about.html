  <h2>How Actually I Got Started</h2>
  <p>As mentioned, I’m a sailor whose name is Sarath Kumar Komatlapalli.
    It has been a long day for me on my ship and even though it’s my last
    day onboard ship as my signed contract is completed.
    Finally, the time is 11:00 PM the night and got a call saying that
    get ready to go home.</p>
  <p>Just imagine how it feels by hearing the word ‘home’ after 9 months,
    feels thrilled right. Yes, I felt the same but didn’t expect that
    will be the last day of my sailor career.

    Came home with lots of gifts for my family and friends and
    spend a lot of time with my family with so much fun, the days are
    going it’s been a month since I came back from my ship but all of a sudden,
    the pandemic had arrived with the name CARONA virus (Covid-19).
    Luckily, I came back home before the pandemic.
    I’m trying to complete my 1st sailing experience certificate but got
    too late I’m trying harder and harder to get into a ship with my new contract
    but no it’s not happened.The days from my second month at home turned one year
    at home with a light-speed, feels disgusting right. I felt more than that but
    I still didn’t stop applying for my new contract but the situation
    is going down and down.</p>
  <p>Here I got a sudden strike of two Questions
    1.) Where the world is going to?
    2.) What the hell is going to happen to my life?
    These Questions Made My Life
    Basically, I am a person who feels to be my own boss,
    So I started and completed learning Business Management &
    Entrepreneurship Course from an Online Institute called Unschool
    then after some days, I got a striking answer to my first question
    that the world is going towards “digitalization”.
    Got my lappy on my lap and started searching about digitalization.
    This research gave an answer to my second question
    why can’t I learn digital marketing?</p>
  <p>This made me start my journey toward where the world is moving,
    and by selecting my mentor Veerander Chowdary <a href="https://helloveeru.com">(Hello Veeru)</a>
    who has tremendous experience in digital marketing for 7 years.
    He shared all the experiences he had in digitalizing businesses,
    promoting businesses online, promoting other persons or company
    products by affiliate marketing, and sharing
    knowledge on the web by blogging.
    So, Learning from Unschool and from my mentor Hello Veeru
    made me start a freelancing career to help Business personnel,
    where I can digitalize, promote and scale their businesses.
    Hope I will learn a lot through our digital Journey and
    hope you all will love and believe me to get started
    on your own digital journey.</p>
